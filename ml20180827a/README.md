The program will turn on the webcam to capture the live image and use the pre-trained style transfer model to alter the image. In the **data** folder, please download the necessary model files you want to test with. The [models](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style/tree/master/models) are available from the [fast-neural-style](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style) repository of Justin Johnson.

The CVImage library is also required for this sketch. It can be installed properly as a Processing library or temporarily in the **code** folder.
