The program assumes the default webcam size is 640 x 360. Modify it if the webcam setting is not the same. Please also download [CVImage](http://www.magicandlove.com/blog/2018/07/20/opencv-3-4-2-java-build/) for OpenCV 3.4.2 for use. You can install it properly as Processing library or put the files into the **code** folder for temporary testing.
